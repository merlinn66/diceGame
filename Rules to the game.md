# This game does not need any user input
# The game will roll a dice and return a number between 1-6
# It will then roll as many times as the number returned, ie, if you roll a 2, it rolls twice, 3 is three roll and so on
# It will take the same of the secondary rolls and sum them up
# if the sum is even, you lose an equivalent of the sum
# if odd, you gain the amount
# This goes on until until you either lose all your money or double it
# Game Ends


# This is a school project and so will most of the code I'll upload here in cpp

# Danke! Auf Widdersen(??)!!
